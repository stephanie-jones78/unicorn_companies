## What is a Unicorn Company?
In the world of finance, a unicorn company is a private company with a valuation of at least $1 billion. Many current and recent unicorns are **tech startups** located in the Silicon Valley region of California.

These companies are often high-growth companies that have raised private funding aggressively and have differentiated business models in long-term growth markets, such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing or cybersecurity. The term unicorn was first used by venture capitalist Aileen Lee in 2013. At the time Lee used the term, there were fewer than 40 unicorn companies in the world, but now there are more than 700 private companies that qualify as unicorns.
